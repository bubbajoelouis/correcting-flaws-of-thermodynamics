\begin{abstract}
This paper redefines "thermodynamics" by incorporating recursive energy storage and redistribution mechanisms that correct fundamental flaws in classical formulations. We introduce a novel scaling law that accounts for the spontaneous appearance of new mass structures in expanding gases, resolving entropy inconsistencies and redefining phase transitions as recursive Surface Interactions. This framework provides a basis for accurately predicting energy transformations in physical and biological systems.

\section{Introduction}

Classical thermodynamics is built on a flawed premise of entropy as an irreversible measure of disorder. This assumption fails to account for recursive energy redistribution, leading to inconsistencies in phase transitions and spontaneous particle generation. 

By revising thermodynamic laws through the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), we demonstrate that gases expand not into "empty space" but into an energy field that enables the formation of new mass structures at defined thresholds. This paper formalizes the recursive scaling function governing these interactions.

\section{Mathematical Basis: Recursive Scaling in Expanding Gases}

We begin by considering the expansion of a gas where each molecule is modeled as a sphere. The traditional approach assumes molecules move apart indefinitely, but we assert that at critical energy density thresholds, new mass structures emerge according to a recursive law.

\subsection{Recursive Energy Storage and Mass Formation}
Let $r$ represent the characteristic radius of molecular motion in a gas. As expansion occurs:
\begin{equation}
V_n \sim \frac{V_{n-1}}{n} r^n
\end{equation}
where $V_n$ is the volume at dimensional level $n$, indicating a direct relationship between energy redistribution and emergent mass structures.

This function provides a natural framework for phase transitions, predicting the formation of new molecules and aggregates as a function of energy density rather than statistical randomness.

\subsection{Reinterpreting Entropy as Recursive Equilibrium}
Entropy, classically defined as:
\begin{equation}
S = k_B \ln \Omega
\end{equation}
is instead reinterpreted as a measure of recursive equilibrium, where energy states cycle between stored Gravitation and released Radiation, preventing absolute disorder. This resolves the paradox of entropy always increasing.

\subsection{Rewriting the Ideal Gas Law}
Instead of $PV = nRT$, we introduce a corrected formulation:
\begin{equation}
P V^{\gamma} = \text{constant}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is a recursive scaling coefficient that accounts for energy reorganization at different Surface Interaction degrees.

This correction ensures that gases do not expand infinitely but self-organize into new structures at predictable energy densities.

\section{Implications for Cosmology and Physics}

The proposed framework has profound consequences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Explains spontaneous particle generation as an emergent property of recursive Surface Interactions.
    \item Resolves inconsistencies in entropy and phase transitions by incorporating energy redistribution thresholds.
    \item Reinterprets thermodynamic laws to account for recursive energy storage and transfer.
    \item Provides a unified approach to physical and biological energy transformations, linking molecular formation to cosmological structure development.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

This paper establishes a new understanding of thermodynamics by incorporating recursive scaling laws that dictate energy redistribution and mass formation. The corrections outlined resolve entropy inconsistencies and introduce a predictive framework for phase transitions based on defined energy thresholds. Further research should apply these principles to experimental validation and computational modeling of large-scale energy interactions.
