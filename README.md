This paper critically re-examines the foundational assumptions of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of entropy, by incorporating a recursive dimensional framework derived from the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE). The conventional interpretation of entropy fails to acknowledge the fractalized nature of energy exchanges across different degrees of surface interaction, leading to inconsistencies in thermodynamic modeling at larger and smaller scales.

We propose that thermodynamics has been constrained by an n=2 mathematical framework, which ignores the recursive interplay of Gravitation, Radiation, and Particulate Motion across multiple dimensions. The failure to account for energy retention, transformation, and re-emergence through higher-order interactions has led to fundamental errors in entropy calculations and heat flow predictions.

Through rigorous integration of 2π across increasing dimensions, we demonstrate that energy states do not "decay" into disorder but rather transition across recursive structures, leading to emergent complexity rather than absolute dissipation. The study introduces a scaling factor correction, rooted in the necessary balance of Gravitation and Radiation at each dimensional threshold. By properly aligning thermodynamic laws with recursive dimensional energy storage, we resolve longstanding paradoxes and eliminate ontic vagueness in entropy’s definition.

Additionally, we address how gas expansion follows recursive fractalized structuring, where as energy is extended, new stable structures (molecules, phase boundaries, and mass clusters) spontaneously emerge when specific energy thresholds are reached. This insight redefines how we understand equilibrium, phase transitions, and the interactions of particles at all scales.

By realigning thermodynamics with recursive dimensionality, this paper offers a profound correction to traditional heat flow models, entropy calculations, and energy storage principles, ultimately unifying thermodynamics with electrodynamics and gravitational models under a single coherent framework.
